### Hello curious visitor ðŸ‘‹ You are most welcome here! ðŸ¥³

- Let me give introduce myself. My name is Sara Briki (I'm sure you cann tell by now), and I am a 4<sup>th year software engineering student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology -or, as we call it here âœ¨INSATâœ¨-.
  
- You can take a quick tour around my GitHub profile since it's still under construction and the trajectory is pretty simple.
  Please help yourself!
  
- While I take care of some academic projects and requisites, make yourself at home. I will get back to making this place a little more homely for you to explore as soon as I'm free.
  See you soon ðŸ¤—!
