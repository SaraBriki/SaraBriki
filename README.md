### <div align="center">Hello</div>

- My name is Sara Briki (I'm sure you can tell by now), and I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year software engineering student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology.
  
- My GitHub profile does lack some organization. I'll make it tidier once I finish this piece of code. You can nonetheless find some of my academic projects and lab tasks. Be my guest :)

Happy visit !
